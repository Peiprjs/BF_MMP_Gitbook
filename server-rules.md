  Since our server runs "Offline" (IE. you don't need an official Minecraft
  acount), we have a verification at VPN level. It is recommended to follow a
  Hermitcraft-style SMP, not Dream SMP.

# Server rules

## Rule 1. All Discord rules apply to the SMP.

Please treat each other with respect and follow the Discord TOS! Breaking the TOS will result in an **IMMEDIATE BAN**. Same goes for toxicity.

Racism, sexism, bigotry and hate speech in this server will not be tolerated. 

This server **English Only**. 

Keep the general chat PG 15. 

Avoid controversial topics and discourse. Keep these discussions in DMs.

**DO NOT** post links

Credit all the artworks you share/use, either by mentioning the artist's name or linking their profile in a book available to everyone

If there's anything that the mods deem unsuitable for the server, thou shall be let known.

## Rule 2. No griefing/stealing.

We want the server to be as... vainilla-ish as possible. So, no griefing-prevention. Wars are allowed, but you must consult the parties involved and take the war somewhere that will not disturb. 

## Rule 3. No NSFW artwork/imagery in publicly displayed.

You can import NSFW content, but you should keep it in a private space, somewhere that can't be accidentally seen.

## Rule 4. Remember the Human.

If you think it's unfitted for the server, then DON'T DO IT. If you wouldn't like it done to you, then DON'T DO IT. If the other party doesn't agree, then DON'T DO IT. It's pretty simple.
